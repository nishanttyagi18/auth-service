# Backend Task for Engineering Role

- Some of things like logger/code-documentation are missing just to make the code simple and clear.
- .env is not ignored for VCS because it doesn't contain any sensitive information.
- Some code may look repetitive, but that is just to make things clear.
- File and folder structure might not be the best, but I tried to complete the task as fast as possible.
- Code can be improved by following more best practices.

> **If any improvement is needed, just create an issue and I will work on it.**
